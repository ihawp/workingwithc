# What is this?

Was built as part of my certificate at Saskatchewan Polytechnic... we had to build a game using p5.js and then build the same game using another method, I opted for C because I wanted to learn about it! Of course I did not get to a visual stage, but the logic does work, and the game is playable if you think in terms of (x, y).
